LAB 4: INTRODUCTION TO FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
WITH REACT

Objective(s):
i. To understand the basics of frontend development using React.
ii. To learn the core concepts of React such as components, state, and props.
iii. To fetch data from a backend API and display it dynamically in a React
application.

Software(s) Required:
Python, React (Node.js)

Theory:

Frontend development focuses on building the user interface (UI) of web applications — the part users see and interact with in their browsers. Modern frontend development emphasizes dynamic content, fast user interactions, and reusable UI components. One of the most popular libraries used for this purpose is React. React is a JavaScript library developed by Meta Platforms for building interactive and efficient user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). Instead of manipulating the DOM directly, React uses a **Virtual DOM**, which improves performance by updating only the necessary parts of the webpage when data changes. A key concept in React is component-based architecture. In React, the UI is divided into independent and reusable components. Each component manages its own structure, logic, and behavior, making applications easier to develop, maintain, and scale. Components can be either functional or class-based, with modern React primarily using functional components along with Hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`. React follows a declarative programming approach, meaning developers describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React handles updating the DOM accordingly. This improves readability and simplifies debugging. Data in React flows in a unidirectional manner (one-way data binding), which helps maintain predictable application behavior. React applications are typically created using tools like `create-react-app` or modern build tools such as Vite, which set up the development environment and manage dependencies. React can also be combined with routing libraries and state management tools to build complex, real-world applications. Overall, React simplifies frontend development by promoting reusable components, efficient rendering, and structured state management, making it a powerful and widely adopted technology in modern web development.

Discussion and Conclusion:

In this lab, we explored the fundamentals of frontend development using React and gained practical experience in building a simple web application. We learned how to create and structure components, manage state using functional components, and understand how data flows between components. The concept of the Virtual DOM and reusable component-based architecture helped us understand how React efficiently updates the user interface.

Overall, the lab provided a strong foundation in React and modern frontend development practices. By successfully creating a working web application, we developed a clear understanding of how React simplifies UI development, improves code reusability, and enhances performance. This experience will be useful for building more complex and interactive web applications in the future.
